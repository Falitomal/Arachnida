## ‚úèÔ∏è Summary
```

Metadata is information that is used to describe other data; essentially, it is **data about data**.

It is often used in images and documents, **and may reveal sensitive information** about those who created or manipulated it.

```
## üí° About the project

```
Create 2 tools ($texttt{spider}$ and $texttt{scorpion}$) that allow to extract information from a website automatically and then analyze it to know or remove sensitive data.
Functions or libraries that allow to create HTTP requests and handle files can be used,
but the logic of each program must be developed by me, i.e. $texttt{wget}$, $texttt{scrapy}$, or similar libraries cannot be used.


```
## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
```
```
# spider
```
This program must receive as argument a URL from which it will extract the images.

```shell
python3 spider.py -h
```
```
 python spider.py [-r] [-l MAX_DEPTH] [-p PATH] URL
   url: the URL to start the spider
   -r, --recursive: recursively download images
   -l, --max-depth [N]: maximum depth level of the recursive download (default: 5)
   -p, --path [PATH]: path to save downloaded files (default: ./data/)     


```
